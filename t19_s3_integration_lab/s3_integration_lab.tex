\item Confirm that sending messages to the queue works.
\item Subscribe an e-mail address to the SNS topic.
\item Subscribe the queues to the SNS topic.
\item Setup permissions to permit the topic to send to the queues.
\item Setup permissions to let the S3 bucket publish notifications to the SNS topic.
\item Configure the S3 bucket notification to send all create events to the SNS topic.
\item Test using the \texttt{aws s3} and/or \texttt{aws s3api} commands.
\end{enumerate}
