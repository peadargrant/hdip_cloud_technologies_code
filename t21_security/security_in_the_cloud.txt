EC2 instance security
=====================

ec2-user account has root / administrator privilages. 

By default:

- Linux: Inject public key as previously stored in AWS into ec2-user account

- Windows: Random password to encrypt our key

Reasons to *not* set a password:

1. Avoid brute force cracking attempts.
2. Avoid need to enforce complexity of passwords.
