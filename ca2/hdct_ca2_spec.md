In this CA you will identify opportunities for using cloud services for an existing or proposed use case from your own experience.
You should explore AWS' full service catalogue and identify services that you haven't used but could employ in this application. 

You should provide a (max) 4 page PDF with information as required below.

# Problem statement (20%)

Brief description of the applications / services you wish to provide. 

# Identified needs (20%)

What direct AWS resources do you need to install the applications / services identified in the Aims.

# Architectural diagram (40%)

You should provide a clear diagram of the AWS infrastructure you would use.

Ensure that you show any client(s) connecting, and what protocol(s) they will use. 

# Permissions (20%)

Provide a summary of the permission(s) that would need to be set up to enable your proposed solution to operate.

You should broadly identify the identity-based or resourced-based policies you would employ. 

A bullet point summary will suffice - you do not need to create specific AWS policies in JSON format.
